#  Bangalore Metro Shortest Path Finder

Welcome to the **Bangalore Metro Shortest Path Finder** project!  
This full-stack web application helps commuters in Bangalore find the **shortest path** between two metro stations and calculates the **fare** for the journey.  

It combines a **React.js frontend** with an **Express.js backend**, powered by **Dijkstra's algorithm** for pathfinding.
